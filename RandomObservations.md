# Observations
I'm recording some notes for myself about the workflow, since I took a break between modules. These are observations about the tools and workflow.
* GitHub isn't hard, but the UI is unintuitive. There's a lot of scrolling. And I find the button I need to click is often nowhere my cursor, or the icon isn't one I'm intuitively drawn to. GUIs are like dialects in that you might know the language, but getting used to a new one can involve a few awkward introductory conversations.
* I very quickly forgot my workflow for saving posts for the research notebook. In a nutshell, it's to type in dilinger.io, then save to nvalt, then sync to GitHub.
## Some questions about that workflow: 
* is it really necessary to save it to my GitHub desktop and then sync it to the online version? What is it in my preferences that created this step? 
* How do I get my whole research notebook (i.e., all the posts) into my GitHub web page? I can see my homepage just fine, but it is static and the notebook posts are just hanging out in my repository.
