Notes from: 

Tim Hitchcock, "Big Data for Dead People: Digital Readings and the Conundrums of Positivism," in  Historyonics (Dec 9, 2013).

##### Note 1
Hitchcock talks about distant reading as the natural way to reveal certain patterns or big-picture themes. He uses Ben Schmidt's work on the evolution of masculinity in Mad Men as an example (Hitchcock, Big Data). 

##### Note 2
Context is just as important in big data/distant readings as in closer reading. This is apparent in his discussion of comparisons to normal word use: "the existence of something like Google Books and the Ngram viewer ... actually can change the character of how we ‘read’ a sentence, a word, a phrase, a genre – by giving a norm against which to compare it." (Hitchcock, Big Data). 

##### Note 3
The juxtaposition of case study and field-wide observations throughout the piece echoes his argument that we should combine close and distant reading for the most nuanced research (Hitchcock, Big Data). 

##### Note 4
Upon reading his observation that the image of the long-lost woman in an archive "creates a powerful if under-theorised alternative starting point from which to read text - and has the great advantage of not being ‘text’; or at least not being words," I nod my head (Hitchcock, Big Data). Yes, digital humanities, in its English disciplinary origins, often privileges text in its preferences for tools and methods. Digital art history, for a long time at least, tended to priviledge digitizing images (rather than creating computational or transformative works). Digital history, I think, is a valuable framework for thinking of images and text together. I used to be opposed to--or at the very least, confused by--too many disciplinary distinctions in digital work. But now I see the benefits of both interdiscipinary methods and those that work within the tighter parameters of a discipline.

##### Note 5
XML is still more confusing that it ought to be. (Note to self: another goal for the class is to sort this out).

##### Note 6
His observation that if the Times Digital Archive's OCR capabilities were more sufficient they could do more comparative work is a reminder of how often researchers are at the mercy of outside decisions: how it was digitized, the tools used to preserve it (Hitchcock, Big Data). This is kind of like #archaeology and the serendipitous nature of survival and discovery. 

##### Note 7
Is this what people mean by media archaeology?

##### Note 8
Archival objects as data (Hitchcock, Big Data). That's an important way of thinking about digital research versus the old-school analog kind. 

##### Note 9
I'm finding Hitchcock's citation methods interesting: footnotes and parenthetical citations (Hitchcock, Big Data). New media and blogs are things that the Chicago Manual of Style has struggled to keep up with in terms of codified styles, and I believe this has had an impact how how slowly digital scholarship has been widely accepted by scholarly audiences. 

##### Note 10
He says there are "lots of new readings that change how we connect with historical evidence" he means new *kinds* of reading, new ways of engaging with material that go far beyond text, and that, "It [the application of immersive digital experience] suggests that reading can be different; and should include the haptic - the feel and heft of a thing in your hand," (Hitchcock, Big Data). Oooh, this is terrific. And interestingly enough, says a lot about how we need to work to understand Byzantine art as well, as experience rather than single-sensory viewing. #archaeology #image

##### Note 11
A major point of Hitchcock's is that we shouldn't let technology determine the research questions we're asking (Hitchcock, Big Data).
