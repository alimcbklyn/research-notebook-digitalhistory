I looked at the website for the [Commonwealth War Graves Commission](http://www.cwgc.org/) website for examples of well-structured data. Just seeing the search interface was an *a-ha!* moment in that context because I was suddenly able to visualize the relationship between a well-structured database and the front-end user interface for searching. 

The data itself was interesting and sad, seemingly infinite listings of people who had perished in wars. I searched for my surname and found lots of examples, which was not surprising because my family name is Scotch-Irish in origin. There's also a museum in Canada with my surname, although I don't know of any living relatives in any part of the Commonwealth. This little bit of reflecting highlights the fact that data is usually quite personal to someone, somewhere, echoing Shawn's argument in the assignment sheet that power and ethics that are inherent in the exchange we create in modeling or visualizing someone else's data.
