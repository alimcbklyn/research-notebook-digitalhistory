<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/146202021">Nudibranch</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user43521015">Matthew Rossi</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

This is a video that my partner, Matt, made of a nudibranch (a tiny marine mollusk). He filmed it using a DIY microscope called a Foldscope that was connected to an iPhone. In our house, the connection between writing and making things (both digital and analog) is a frequent topic of conversation. You can see some photos of his work and read my write-up of a studio visit with him on my blog, [After Vasari](https://aftervasari.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/studio-visit-matthew-l-rossi/).
